Hi, I'm **Marcelo**, an Infrastructure & Security Analyst based in Fortaleza, Brazil.

With over a decade of experience, I specialize in cloud automation, secure DevOps pipelines, and resilient infrastructure. I bridge operations and security through IaC, observability, and hardening — with hands-on expertise across AWS, Fortinet, Terraform, and more.

Currently working at HMIT, building secure and scalable environments for financial institutions.
